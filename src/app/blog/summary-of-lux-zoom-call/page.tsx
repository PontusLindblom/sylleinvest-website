            <h1>Summary of Newlox&#39;s Zoom Call</h1>
            <div className={styles.publishDate}>Published 2022-07-23</div>

            <h2>Plant 1 - Oro Roca, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                The plant is currently in production and ramping up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Q3, they have increased productivity and revenues
                month-over-month consistently. They would’ve liked to have
                been further at this point, but they are still pleased that
                they are growing every month.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier this year (May 12th, 2022), they announced they were
                testing the 50 tpd level again, which is where they got
                stuck in the fall. They are still at around 50 tpd and have
                not gone far beyond that level.
            </p>

            <h2>Plant 2 - Boston, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                All the major equipment is now on site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plant site has been built, including the pad, structure, ore
                ramp, tailings pond, and processing tanks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrical upgrades are completed, and new power systems have
                been installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ball mill and floatation systems are on site and being
                installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, the major focus is the conveyor system and other
                material handling equipment that’s under construction by local
                contractors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pictures from the presentation showed progress on
                construction since the company’s video from May 11th, 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                The construction should be done fairly soon. Testing will be
                done after the construction, ensuring everything is operating
                and reliable. Then they will move to the commissioning. Gold
                will be produced during the testing and commissioning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Testing and commissioning should take around 2-3 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are looking to complete the ramp-up in 2023.
            </p>

            <h2>Plant 3 - Antioquia. Columbia</h2>
            <p>
                Plant 3 ended up in Colombia because they signed an agreement
                earlier than in Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Due Diligence is completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Permitting is underway for a 1,000 tpd operation, and the
                permitting process is expected to take 9-12 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                They will start at 250 tpd and grow to 1,000 tpd. As the
                permitting is for 1,000 tpd, they don’t need to seek permits for
                increased production.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a semi-modular design where they can increase production
                as they go.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cut-off grade is 9 g/ton, and at 1,000 tpd, the plant will
                produce more than 80,000 oz/year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies are already processing material mined by the
                local miners, so the practice is well-known and accepted.
            </p>

            <h2>The Brazil Expansion</h2>
            <p>
                They are still in negotiations and final legal to pick up a
                project, which has taken longer than anticipated.
            </p>

            <h2>Economics</h2>
            <p>
                They have around $3M.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plant 1 does not require any more capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Plant 2, most of the money has already been spent. It will
                require some money during the commercialization and ramp-up, and
                that’s fully funded.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only place Newlox may need to raise some capital is for the
                construction of new and larger projects. Money becomes easier to
                raise the further they’ve gotten. There is no near-term need to
                raise money, and if they do raise money, it will most likely be
                non-dilutive (e.g. a bank loan).
            </p>

            <h2>Misc.</h2>
            <p>
                Plant 1 & 2 has basically saturated the Costa Rica market, where
                Newlox will be the main processor for artisanal mining and
                working with artisanal miners in Costa Rica.
            </p>
            <p>
                They will be working on the OTCQB uplisting somewhere in the
                fall, and they think it would be nice to be listed before the
                end of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Ryan was asked why there is no insider buying at these
                levels, he replied that he is basically all in on Newlox with
                pretty much all his money, so he doesn’t have much more to put
                into it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is around 20% insider ownership.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal Comment</h2>
            <p>
                As the Zoom Call has not been published by the company yet, I
                decided to make this summary for those that could not attend.
                Ryan is a good speaker and I think he did a great job at
                answering the questions that were asked. I also have to give him
                credit for staying 20 minutes longer so that he could reply to
                all of the questions.
