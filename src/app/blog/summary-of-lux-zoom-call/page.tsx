            <h1>Summary of Newlox&#39;s Zoom Call</h1>
            <div className={styles.publishDate}>Published 2022-07-23</div>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Plant 1 - Oro Roca, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                The plant is currently in production and ramping up. Since Q3,
                they have increased productivity and revenues month-over-month
                consistently. They would&#39;ve liked to have come further, but
                they are still pleased that they are growing every month.
                Earlier this year (May 12th, 2022), they announced they were
                testing the 50 tpd level again, where they got stuck in the
                fall. They are still at around 50 tpd and have yet to go far
                beyond that level.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Plant 2 - Boston, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                All the major equipment is now on site. The plant site has been
                built, including the pad, structure, ore ramp, tailings pond,
                and processing tanks. Electrical upgrades are completed, and new
                power systems have been installed. The ball mill and floatation
                systems are on site and being installed. At this point, the
                primary focus is the conveyor system and other material handling
                equipment under construction by local contractors. The pictures
                from the presentation showed progress on construction since the
                company&#39;s video from May 11th, 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                The construction should be done fairly soon. Testing will be
                done after the construction, ensuring everything is operating
                and reliable. Then they will move to the commissioning. Gold
                will be produced during the testing and commissioning. Testing
                and commissioning should take around 2-3 months, and they are
                looking to complete the ramp-up in 2023.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Plant 3 - Antioquia. Columbia</h2>
            <p>
                Plant 3 ended up in Colombia because they signed an agreement
                earlier than in Brazil. The Due Diligence is completed, and
                permitting is underway for a 1,000 tpd operation. The permitting
                process is expected to take 9-12 months. They will start at 250
                tpd and grow to 1,000 tpd. As the permitting is for 1,000 tpd,
                they don&#39;t need to seek permits for increased production. It
                is a semi-modular design where they can increase production as
                they go. The cut-off grade is 9 g/ton; at 1,000 tpd, the plant
                will produce more than 80,000 oz/year. Some companies are
                already processing material mined by local miners, so the
                practice is well-known and accepted.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>The Brazil Expansion</h2>
            <p>
                They are still in negotiations and final legal to pick up a
                project, which has taken longer than anticipated.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Economics</h2>
            <p>
                They have around $3M. Plant 1 requires no more capital, and most
                of the money has already been spent in Plant 2. It will require
                some cash during the commercialization and ramp-up, and
                that&#39;s fully funded. The only place Newlox may need to raise
                some capital is for the construction of new and larger projects.
                Money becomes easier to raise the further they&#39;ve gotten.
                There is no near-term need to raise money; if they do, it will
                most likely be non-dilutive (e.g., a bank loan).
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Misc.</h2>
            <p>
                Plant 1 & 2 has basically saturated the Costa Rica market, where
                Newlox will be the main processor for artisanal mining and
                working with artisanal miners in Costa Rica. They will be
                working on the OTCQB uplisting somewhere in the fall, and they
                think it would be nice to be listed before the end of the year.
                When Ryan was asked why there is no insider buying at these
                levels, he replied that he is basically all in on Newlox with
                pretty much all his money, so he doesn&#39;t have much more to
                put into it. There is around 20% insider ownership.

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Personal Comment</h2>
            <p>
                As the Zoom Call has not been published by the company yet, I
                decided to make this summary for those that could not attend.
                Ryan is a good speaker and I think he did a great job at
                answering the questions that were asked. I also have to give him
                credit for staying 20 minutes longer so that he could reply to
                all of the questions.
