            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>The Ramp-up</h3>
            <p>
                They’re just passing through the 50 tons/day level again, where
                they earlier had metallurgical issues. They’ve applied the new
                chemical formula with success. The problem appears to be fixed,
                and the productivity and recovery levels are stable. The ramp-up
                is proceeding smoothly, and so far, they’re not experiencing any
                problems. Though, they’re expecting the ramp-up to continue
                semi-smoothly. There will always be some problems along the way.
                Mainly equipment problems, as the equipment is constantly
                running and needs to be fixed.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>The Ramp-up Process</h3>
            <p>
                The plant has a frontend and a backend. The frontend is the
                concentrating part of the plant, and the backend takes the
                concentrate and turns it into gold doré. It’s the frontend
                that’s improved during the ramp-up. From a metallurgical
                perspective, they take a large amount of material and
                concentrate it into a small volume at 80-250 g/ton. That
                concentration ratio is what they’re working on at all times. The
                higher the concentration level, the lower the recovery rate. The
                challenge is to increase the concentration ratio while not
                losing too much recovery. This was the issue they had in the
                fall. The gold recovery fell when they tried to increase the
                concentration ratio beyond a certain point to run 50 tons/day or
                more through the plant. Currently, the ramp-up process is about
                putting more material through while making sure nothing breaks
                in a physical aspect and from a metallurgical point of view.

                Q4 Production and Q3 Financials
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Q4 gold production was similar to Q3, as they still hadn’t
                received the reagents. They were trying various things to
                increase productivity during the quarter, but the results stayed
                basically the same. They had hoped for more than a 145% increase
                in the Q3 financials, but you have to take an improvement for
                what it is and be pleased with it. Going forward, they are
                planning to move away from incremental increases to more
                dramatic increases.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Cut-off Grade in Tailings</h3>
            <p>
                9 g/ton was selected as the cut-off grade because it can be
                sourced at all times without too much difficulty. Part of the
                reason why the margins have been high in the financials is
                because of the lower throughput, as they could cherry-pick
                tailings with higher gold content. So far, they’ve seen closer
                to 10-11 g/ton of gold in the tailings, but they expect gold
                content slightly above 9 g/ton going forward.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Productivity News Release</h3>
            <p>
                An update on productivity is coming, but they want to be careful
                when announcing it to ensure that things are working without a
                doubt. Ryan could not give any more details in the interview as
                the productivity numbers are not public information yet.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Plant 2 - Boston, Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                The equipment installation is proceeding nicely. The next step
                is showing the equipment being installed. That is currently
                underway, and we can expect another video and pictures showing
                that shortly. Commissioning starts in certain aspects, even as
                construction is ongoing. Once things get installed, they are
                tested, ensuring the equipment turns properly, etc. Within a
                couple of weeks of the equipment being bolted to the ground, we
                should be seeing some things turning. Newlox is a few months
                away from having everything plummed together and testing with
                material going through.

                <em>
                    Personal note: Ryan mentioned trying to avoid getting people
                    fixated on near-term goals that can shift all over the
                    place. What matters for them is the long-term, creating a
                    stable company that does reclamation and produces a lot of
                    revenue that allows them to grow. I agree with him. Getting
                    too focused on the near-term catalysts makes it easy to lose
                    sight of the big picture, but one should of course always be
                    critical of what is conveyed and what is delivered.

                They’ve hired legal counsel in Canada specializing in Canadian
                companies dealing in Brazil. They’re currently working on the
                final negotiation and finishing up some last Due-Diligence in
                Brazil. At the same time, they’re also negotiating two other
                properties actively, one in Columbia and one in Ecuador. These
                are the three most active negotiations, and there are projects
                all over Latin America that they’re doing Due-Diligence on. They
                expect the Brazil contract to be the first one signed. There is
                currently more deal flow than they can handle.

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>OAR (Organic Aqua Regia)</h2>
            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>What They Are Testing</h3>
            <p>
                The in-field testing they plan to/are doing with the OAR
                technology:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Larger in-field tests than what they did in the lab. They’re
                    going to be “scaling scaling scaling”, ensuring OAR works at
                    a large scale.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checking how the environmental conditions affect the
                    process. They expect it to be better than the lab, as
                    earlier tests indicate better results in higher
                    temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recycling tests to see how many times they can use the
                    reagent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They’re still a fair way from deploying on a commercial level.
                They will be doing in-field testing over the remainder of the
                year and most likely start the in-production testing somewhere
                next year. Incremental news will be provided once/if progress is
                made.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Many Have Tried Before</h3>
            <p>
                Many people have tried selling solutions (like OAR) that require
                changing the entire chemical metallurgy of the plant. The
                biggest problem in the mining tech industry is that, even if
                your system works, nobody wants it. The big mining companies
                might’ve spent $10-100M derisking large mining projects and a
                decade in permitting. They don’t want a new system that requires
                them to change their current system and potentially restart
                permitting. The technology has to be established as proven,
                beyond any doubt, before any larger company would be interested
                in it. That’s Newlox’s strategy.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Designed With OAR in Mind</h3>
            <p>
                The plants are designed modularly. The backend of the plant can
                be removed, and the OAR can be slotted in without changing the
                frontend. It’s designed so they can put OAR into their projects
                and deploy them widely. Once it’s used in multiple projects in
                multiple jurisdictions, it becomes a proven technology without
                depending on finding another company to be a partner to do the
                deployment. The government in Costa Rica is really excited about
                OAR. During the testing phase, there’re likely going to
                demonstrate it to several members of congress and the mining
                department.

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Tailings</h2>
            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Bad, Good, Best</h3>
            <p>
                The tailings that leave Newlox, go to a tailings pond that is
                fully permitted, and that’s the final destination. It’s a bad,
                good, best situation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bad:</strong> the tailings are spread all across the
                    landscape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Good:</strong> having that material contained
                    underwater to prevent acid mine drainage, which is the
                    normal problem you have with tailings. Sulfites produce
                    acid, and that acid can damage the environment. That’s why
                    these tailings facilities are underwater, as access to the
                    air causes that acid production. Tailings ponds are the
                    currently best available solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Best:</strong> the remediation technologies that
                    Newlox is working on.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>The Remediation Idea</h3>
            <p>
                The idea for their remediation plants (tailings plants) is to
                have a silver plate solution in the frontend that removes most
                of the mercury, and a chemical solution in the backend that
                remineralizes the remaining mercury. The silver plate solution
                has been tested in-field and appears to extract 90%+ of the
                mercury. They’re currently building the full-scale system and
                testing it, expecting it to be deployed soon. The chemical
                solution is a technology that locks the mercury back into a
                mineral form, so it doesn’t seep (like the mercury-containing
                rocks that are naturally in the environment). If they can do
                that properly, then the material becomes inert enough that you
                could form products with it or backfill historical and no longer
                operating mining shafts.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Solidified Mercury</h3>
            <p>
                The solidified mercury (the by-product of extracting the
                mercury) is handed over to the ministry in Costa Rica for free.
                They could technically sell it, there is a market for mercury,
                but they’re not sure that it’s the right thing to do, as it
                could end up in tailings again. The whole point of Newlox’s
                operations is to make the world better.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    Personal note: I am uncertain if Newlox is currently using
                    the chemical solution (backend) in production. And
                    currently, they do not seem to be using the silver plate
                    solution (frontend), but it appears that the silver plate
                    solution might end up in production very soon.

            <h2 className={styles.h2Padding}>Misc.</h2>
            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>OTCQB</h3>
            <p>
                They stepped back from actively working on the uplisting as
                other things took precedent. They’re probably going to restart
                that process post AGM. There is a lot of interest in the US,
                both from people and an ESG fund. They want to proceed with the
                uplisting, but they want to focus on the more critical things
                first. The uplisting is expected to happen somewhere this year.
                The reason the uplisting was not completed in a few weeks, as
                stated in my and Ryan’s last interview, was because it took a
                while to get all the records and corporate administration
                transferred to Francis, the new Corporate Secretary. Right now,
                she’s occupied with the AGM, financials, and audit.

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>Director Compensation</h3>
            <p>
                When asked why the two directors, David C. Carkeek and Gary
                MacDonald, have not received any compensation in the fiscal
                years 2019 to 2021, the response was that they are strong
                supporters of the company and haven’t asked for a salary. They
                mainly make introductions to the company, work at AGM times, and
                do occasional board meetings.
            </p>

            <h3 className={styles.h3Padding}>The Newlox Team</h3>
            <p>
                Both new recruits, Frances (Corporate Secretary) and Wilmer (VP
                of Operations), are adjusting well to their new roles in the
                company. Frances is basically full-time, and Ryan is quite
                amazed at the fantastic job she is doing. Newlox has tried
                outside hired corporate secretarial work before. And generally
                speaking, Ryan found that he had to be involved in everything,
                or else things did not go the way they expected or hoped. That’s
                not the case with Frances. They’re also very pleased with
                Wilmer. He and his junior engineer figured out how to fix the
                metallurgical problem in the Autumn. Newlox sent their recipe to
                a third-party lab along with samples, and they were able to
                verify their recipe in their lab using Newlox’s material and
                reagents. And so far, it is working in the field. Wilmer has
                also suggested a lot of things regarding the construction of
                Plant 2, as well as upgrades on Plant 1. His level of
                professionalism and knowledge is significantly better than
                people Newlox has been working with in the past.

                Advisory Board and Expanding the Team
            </h3>
            <p>
                Newlox has a strong advisory board and is increasing the amount
                of time they work with them on strategic planning etc. Some
                advisors may come in on more formal positions as the company
                moves forward, especially as they have Project 3 coming on, but
                Newlox wants to keep the bloat down until they’re operating at a
                larger scale. When they expand their team, they’re mainly
                looking to add to their operations side.
