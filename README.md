### This website will replace https://www.sylleinvest.com/ when it contains the same level of functionality.

#### _The reason for this change is because the current website use CRA (Create React App) which contains too much functionality and dependencies. This project uses Next.js 13 which has less dependencies and comes with SSG (Static Site Generation) from the get go instead of using CSR (Client Side Rendering). The new way of rendering is better suited for a blog._

## How to run the project

Run the code below and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## API routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

Files in the `/api/` directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
